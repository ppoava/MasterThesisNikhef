Double counting was implemented in previous versions of the code, but is NOT implemented in the newest versions (from 23 dec onwards) so they will have to be divided by 2 manually in the double counting code, or certain combinations have to be made to account for this (e.g. BpBm + BmBp / BpBp + BmBm)
